# Project Description: Geo-Compliance Feature Flagging System

This document provides a detailed explanation of the Geo-Compliance Feature Flagging System prototype.

## Problem Statement

In today's global digital landscape, technology companies face a significant challenge in ensuring their products and features comply with a complex and ever-evolving web of geo-specific regulations. Manually identifying which new features require special compliance logic for different regions is a time-consuming, error-prone process. This manual approach leads to increased governance costs, exposure to legal and financial risks from undetected compliance gaps, and a lack of transparent, auditable evidence for regulatory inquiries. This project aims to build a prototype system that utilizes LLM capabilities to automate the detection of these requirements, turning regulatory compliance from a reactive burden into a proactive, traceable, and auditable process.

## Features and Functionality

The core of this prototype is a Python-based command-line application that automates the analysis of feature descriptions.

- **Automated Compliance Analysis:** The system takes a CSV file containing feature names and descriptions as input.
- **LLM-Powered Intelligence:** It uses OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo model to analyze each description, leveraging a carefully engineered prompt to distinguish between legally mandated requirements and business-driven regional variations.
- **Structured Output:** For each feature, the system outputs:
    - `is_geo_compliance_needed`: A boolean flag (`true`/`false`).
    - `reasoning`: A clear, human-readable explanation for the classification.
    - `relevant_regulation`: The specific law or regulation identified, if any.
- **Audit-Ready Trail:** The output is saved to a new CSV file, creating a persistent and auditable record of the analysis.
- **Extensible by Design:** The system is built with modularity in mind, allowing for future enhancements such as a "self-evolving" feedback loop where human validation could be used to fine-tune the analysis process.

## Development Stack

- **Development Tool:** Python 3
- **APIs Used:** OpenAI API (specifically, the `gpt-4-turbo` model)
- **Libraries Used:**
    - `openai`: To interact with the OpenAI API.
    - `python-dotenv`: To manage environment variables securely (for the API key).
    - `argparse`: To create a user-friendly command-line interface.
    - `csv`: For reading and writing data files.
- **Assets Used:** The initial dataset provided in `sample_data.csv` serves as the primary asset for demonstrating the system's capabilities.
- **Additional Datasets:** No additional datasets were used beyond the provided sample data.

## GitHub Repository

A public GitHub repository with the complete source code and this documentation will be made available. It will include a `README.md` file with instructions for a locally runnable demo.
